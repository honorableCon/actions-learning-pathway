## Essentials of GitHub Actions learning pathway demo repository

This repository contains the core web application files and configuration you'll need to follow along through the [Essentials of automated application deployment with GitHub Actions & GitHub Pages](https://resources.github.com/learn/pathways/essentials/automated-application-deployment-with-github-actions-and-pages) module.

If you have arrived here from the [Intermediate automation strategies with GitHub Actions](https://resources.github.com/learn/pathways/automation/intermediate/workflow-automation-with-github-actions/) module without following the first module, copy the contents of the **/demo-files** folder into the **.github/workflows** folder to follow along.
